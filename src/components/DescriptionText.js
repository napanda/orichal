    <p>
      The Orichal Smart Beta Liquidity Index (SBLI) aims to provide liquidity
      adjusted exposure in digital asset market. SBLI plans clear rules around
      the liquidity, custody and portfolio rebalancing as well as further
      screening on the eligibility of the digital assets being considered.
      Further optimization factors are applied to reduce exposure when downside
      momentum is observed in the overall cryptocurrency market, while
      dynamically scales the weightings within the index underlying. The world
      of digital assets is still at its early stage as there are still some
      limitations and barriers on well established methods compared to
      traditional asset indexing. SBLI strives to bridge the traditional
      investment frameworks while making the required adjustments to suit the
      current constraints of this asset class, with the aim of prioritising
      exposure adjusted for liquidity.
